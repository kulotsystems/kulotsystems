### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Arvic.

I am a web developer with a strong understanding of front-end and back-end development,
as well as database management and software design.
I have experience with technologies such as
[**React**](https://reactjs.org/),
[**Vue**](https://vuejs.org/),
and
[**Laravel**](https://laravel.com/),
but I am always looking to expand my skillset.

In addition to my development work, I also have a passion for teaching others about technology.
